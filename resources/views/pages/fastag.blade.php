               <p class="text-justify">A FASTag is a reloadable tag which is used to automatically deduct toll charges allowing a vehicle to pass through a toll gate without stopping for the payment. It uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to make cashless payments through a prepaid account linked to it......</p>
               <p class="text-center">FASTags are fixed to the windscreen of a vehicle and an RFID antenna in the canopy of the toll gate scans the QR code and the tag identification number, following which the boom barrier lifts to allow a vehicle to pass through. The FASTag is valid for a period of five years.</p>

      	<p>Getting stuck in long queues while crossing NHAI tolls is perhaps something we have all experienced at some point. National Highways Authority of India or NHAI plans to make this a thing of the past by launching NHAI FASTag program in April, 2016. The ultimate plan is to offer non-stop movement of vehicles through toll plazas and cashless collection of toll gate fees at toll plazas. This implementation by the Indian government has been applauded by all, which is evident from the fact that automatic collections at toll plazas along national highways, in conjunction with toll plaza free passes, has led to 24% increase in electronic toll revenue. The number of FASTag units sold has also increased drastically from 3,113 FASTag toll pass units sold in May 2016 to over 3 Million units until August 2018. Indian transportation as we know is the backbone of Indian economy, and with this move, this backbone will only strengthen.</p>
